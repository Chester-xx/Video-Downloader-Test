# To Do List

**NOW**

- Find a better way to use ffmpeg when using standard download option
    1. very slow for large files
    2. only utilizes cpu, why not try gpu
    3. maybe theres a better postprocess method??
- Improve download quality options
- Expand video information panel (desc, duration, upload date)
- Download history section (+redownload option?, clear history, pin favs?)
- add option so save file as a speecific name (in preview add final file name.ext)
- Program information and about section
- user menu panel
- animate downloads?
- Language options?
