GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE  
Version 3, 29 June 2007  

Copyright (c) 2025 Maximus Bergmann

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies  
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.  

## **Overview**

This software may **not be sold, licensed, rented, or otherwise used for commercial purposes** without the explicit written permission of the original author.

## **Preamble**  

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.  

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program—to make sure it remains free software for all its users.  

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.  

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.  

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on the same freedoms to the recipients. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.  

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute, and/or modify it.  

For the developers’ and authors’ protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users’ and authors’ sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.  

## **TERMS AND CONDITIONS**  

### **0. Definitions**  

“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.  
“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.  

Each licensee is addressed as “you.”  

### **1. Source Code**  

The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.  

### **2. Basic Permissions**  

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program.  

You may make, run, and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License.  

### **4. Disclaiming Warranty and Liability**  

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED.  

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.
